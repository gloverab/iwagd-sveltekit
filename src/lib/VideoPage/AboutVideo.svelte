  <p class='text-white text-sm font-thin tracking-wide'>"Drawing Your Recurve" takes us through an energetic crescendo that lashes out with force in its last movements. The short is inspired by the story of David and Goliath; taken from the view of David the moment the giant is approaching: he has one shot with a small sling to save the world. Facing the consequence of failure is not an option no matter what the odds may be. The excited, nervous, confident inhale before launching your one and only attack. This moment forces us to reflect on the greatest struggle that exists today: the existential void.</p>
  <p class='text-white text-sm tracking-wide'>We follow Nerea, portrayed by Olaya LÃ³pez, through an existential loop; battling emotional decay and uncertainty, and trying to escape the pattern. Her journey leads her to an explosive catharsis where she tries and fails to find relief, detailing her encounters along the way. However, she finds the support of her loved ones; those who make the road easier to travel, capturing a generational and universal portrait of a situation that afflicts us all.</p>
