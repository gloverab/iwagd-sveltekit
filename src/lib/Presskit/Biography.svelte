    <p><span class='font-bold'>It Was A Good Dream</span> is a Boston-based instrumental/post-rock band that began in early 2018.</p>
    <p>Their debut album Help Me To Recollect is saturated with a brightly haunted atmosphere; recorded in a centuries-old Masonic Temple-turned recording studio in Northeastern Massachusetts. The historical live room graciously left its fingerprints all over the recordings - gorgeously architected 50-foot tall ceilings end where effect pedals begin. Drums shake unreachable shelves and cymbals crash in their wake, bringing to life the resident dust in long-forgotten hallways. Unplanned creaks and rattles invite the listener to explore each deeply layered sound expertly captured by producer James Bridges (Caspian, American Echoes, Mike Gordon).</p>
    <p>Released in May 2019 through dunk!records worldwide, Help Me To Recollect generated buzz with publications including Heavy Blog is Heavy and Where Post Rock Dwells.</p>
