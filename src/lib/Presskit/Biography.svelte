    <!-- <p><span class='font-bold'>It Was A Good Dream</span> is a Boston-based instrumental/post-rock band that began in early 2018. The project began as a compositional exercise for longtime friends and collaborators Chris Anthony and Alex Glover, and quickly grew into something larger than either anticipated.</p>
    <p>Combining an experimental heart with a penchant for melody, the duo uses boundary-pushing studio technique and unconventional live looping to bring their dream-like vision to life. The result is a cinematic sound that’s as thrilling as it is moody - a devastating take on heavy-hitting rock music interwoven with futuristic melodic ambience. The mood-altering music was perhaps put into words best by <span class='font-bold'>Everything Is Noise</span> writer Vidur Paliwal. <span class='italic'>“Rarely does it occur, that an album can transpose me into a certain atmosphere,” he says, “irrespective of the state of mind I had when I started listening to the album.”</span></p>
    <p>In 2019, It Was a Good Dream released their debut album <span class='italic'>Help Me To Recollect</span> (<span class='font-bold'>Dunk! Records</span>), and quickly won the hearts of post-rock fans and publications worldwide. The album is saturated with a brightly haunted atmosphere; recorded in a centuries-old Masonic Temple-turned recording studio in Northeastern Massachusetts. The historical live room graciously left its fingerprints all over the recordings - gorgeously architected 50-foot tall ceilings end where effect pedals begin. Drums shake unreachable shelves and cymbals crash in their wake, bringing to life the resident dust in long-forgotten hallways. Unplanned creaks and rattles invite the listener to explore each deeply layered sound expertly captured by producer James Bridges (Caspian, American Echoes, Mike Gordon).</p>
    <p>In late 2020, after several pandemic-induced tour cancellations, the duo returned to the studio. With writing influenced both consciously and subconsciously by the state of the world around them, they hunkered down to record their second LP, <span class='italic'>Rememory</span> (TBD Fall 2022). The result is a dynamic journey that expands on the immersive sounds and enchanting melodies that they became known for, culminating in the 17-minute mini-opus, Spooling Lines Into the Deep.</p> -->
